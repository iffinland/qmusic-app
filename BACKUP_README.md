# Q-Music Backup System

This backup system ensures you never lose your working code again!

## 🛡️ Backup Scripts

### `./backup.sh` - Create Backups
Creates comprehensive backups of your project:
- **File backups**: Copies of App.jsx, styles.css, package.json
- **Full project archive**: Complete project backup (excluding node_modules)
- **Git branches**: Creates timestamped backup branches
- **Build testing**: Verifies your code still builds
- **Automatic cleanup**: Keeps only recent backups

### `./restore.sh` - Restore from Backups
Helps you restore from any backup:
- List all available backups
- Restore individual files
- Restore full project
- Switch to git backup branches
- Emergency restore to last working version

## 🚀 Quick Usage

### Create a backup (before making changes):
```bash
./backup.sh
```

### Restore if something breaks:
```bash
./restore.sh
```

### Emergency restore to last known working version:
```bash
./restore.sh
# Choose option 4
```

```

## 🔄 Workflow Recommendations

1. **Before making changes**: `./backup.sh`
2. **After successful changes**: `git add . && git commit -m "description"`
3. **If code breaks**: `./restore.sh`
4. **Daily backup**: `./backup.sh` (creates automatic git branches)

## ⚡ Git Commands

```bash
# See all backup branches
git branch | grep backup

# Switch to emergency backup
git checkout backup-working-version

# Return to main branch
git checkout master

# See recent commits
git log --oneline -10
```

## 🚨 Emergency Recovery

If everything is broken:
1. Run `./restore.sh`
2. Choose option 4 (Emergency restore)
3. This restores to the last known working version
4. Your app should build and work again

## 💡 Tips

- Run `./backup.sh` before trying risky changes
- The backup script tests your build and warns if it fails
- File backups are kept in `backups/` directory
- Git backup branches are automatically cleaned (keeps last 5)
- Always test your build after restoring: `npm run build`

**Remember**: These scripts save your work automatically. Use them frequently!
